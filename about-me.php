			<p>Back home to me is the black sandy beaches of Dominica. This island is one of a kind,
			"the Nature Island of the Caribbean", is where I grew up.
			Then it was off to West Virginia the home of the WVU Mountaineers.
			All me and my friends back then wanted to do was be on tha team one day.
			Ball was life football during any freetime available,then basketball once it got absolutely too cold.
			Some how I ended up in the desert,Abq, New Mexico.
			Overtime i've learning love this place. Never realized how diverse the places i've lived in are. </p>
